# School Database Design

## Tables

### students
Stores one row per student: an `id` (primary key), the student's `name` and their `email`. The email is `UNIQUE`, so two students cannot share one, and both `name` and `email` are `NOT NULL`.

### courses
Stores one row per course: an `id` (primary key), the course `title` and the number of `credits`. Title and credits are `NOT NULL`.

### enrolments
Records the fact that a student is taking a course. Each row has its own `id`, a `student_id` and a `course_id` (both foreign keys and `NOT NULL`), and the `grade` for that student on that course. The grade can be `NULL` while the course is still in progress. A `UNIQUE (student_id, course_id)` rule stops the same student enrolling on the same course twice.

## Relationships

- **students to enrolments: one-to-many.** One student can have many enrolments, but each enrolment belongs to exactly one student.
- **courses to enrolments: one-to-many.** One course can have many enrolments, but each enrolment belongs to exactly one course.
- **students to courses: many-to-many.** A student can take many courses, and a course can have many students.

A many-to-many relationship cannot be stored in a single column without repeating data or putting several values in one cell. The `enrolments` table is the **join table** that solves this. It turns the many-to-many link into two one-to-many links, with one row for each student-and-course pair. It is also the natural home for the grade, because a grade belongs to the pair, not to the student or the course alone.

## Index

I would add an index on `enrolments(course_id)`:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_enrolments_course_id ON enrolments(course_id);
```

**Reason:** queries such as "all students on a course" and "number of students per course" look up enrolments by `course_id`. Without an index the database scans every row in the table, which gets slow as enrolments grow. The `UNIQUE (student_id, course_id)` rule already creates an index that helps searches by student, so the course side is the one that needs it.

## SQL or NoSQL?

I would choose **SQL** for this system. The data is structured and highly related: students, courses and enrolments connect to each other in a fixed, predictable way. SQL enforces that structure with primary keys, foreign keys, `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` rules, so bad data, such as an enrolment for a student who does not exist or a duplicate enrolment, is rejected by the database itself. Queries that combine tables, like finding all courses for a student or counting students per course, are easy to write with `JOIN` and `GROUP BY`. School records also need to be accurate and consistent, which suits SQL's transaction guarantees. NoSQL would be a better fit if the data had no fixed shape or had to scale across many servers, and neither is true of a school database.
