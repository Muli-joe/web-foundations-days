-- ---------- Queries ----------

-- 1. All courses for one student (by name)
SELECT courses.title, enrolments.grade
FROM students
JOIN enrolments ON enrolments.student_id = students.id
JOIN courses    ON courses.id = enrolments.course_id
WHERE students.name = 'Amina Wanjiku';

-- 2. All students on one course
SELECT students.name, students.email
FROM courses
JOIN enrolments ON enrolments.course_id = courses.id
JOIN students   ON students.id = enrolments.student_id
WHERE courses.title = 'Web Development';

-- 3. Number of students per course (LEFT JOIN keeps courses with 0 students)
SELECT courses.title, COUNT(enrolments.id) AS student_count
FROM courses
LEFT JOIN enrolments ON enrolments.course_id = courses.id
GROUP BY courses.id, courses.title;

-- 4. Students who have no enrolments
SELECT students.name
FROM students

WHERE enrolments.id IS NULL;

-- 5. Update one enrolment's grade (Brian's grade in Web Development)
UPDATE enrolments
SET grade = 70
WHERE student_id = 2 AND course_id = 1;

-- Check the update
